Sangha… a simple word carrying a lot of weight.

In Buddhism it means the community of practitioners, the circle that supports each member’s path. Traditionally, it referred to monks and nuns, but over time it’s also come to mean the wider community of seekers and householders who share practice, refuge, and the work of waking up.

A sangha isn’t just about sitting together; it’s the way people hold space for each other when the practice gets messy, dull, or luminous. It’s where teachings get tested in real life, through kindness, friction, patience, and the occasional ego bruise.

Some say without sangha, it’s too easy to drift or collapse into old patterns. Others see it less as “joining a group” and more as weaving a web—each person a strand, stronger when connected.

## *About Mother Spirit Sangha*

Mother Spirit Sangha is a circle of belonging.
We gather in silence, in story, and in community, weaving together an open field of presence.

**Intention**

At the heart is silence — a spacious ground where practice deepens and each person meets themselves with honesty and care.

**Circle**

The sangha is open to all. We meet both online and in person, creating a bridge for near and far. Community leads the way: voices rise, rest, and shape the flow together.

**Rhythm**

We gather three times each month, in step with the lunation cycle.

Each gathering is unique, guided by the energy of the moment and the offerings of those who come.

**Spirit**

“Mother Spirit” speaks to the atmosphere we hold: unconditional love, gentleness, and a fierce protection of what is sacred. Here, every being is welcome as they are, without judgment.
